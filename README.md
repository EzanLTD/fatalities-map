## Data

This locates all known pedestrian fatalities in the United States from 2003-2012. Basic data is drawn from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's [Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)](http://www.nhtsa.gov/FARS) and analyzed by the [National Complete Streets Coalition](http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/complete-streets), a program of [Smart Growth America](http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/), for the report <i>[Dangerous by Design 2014](http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/research/dangerous-by-design/dbd2014/national-overview)</i>. The derived FARS data used to generate this map, including lat/long coordinates, dates, and characteristics of the victims and the crash locations, is [available for download in Google Fusion Tables](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1aKJFPotx1y3p04XW3SkikodoLSrNzxyV4104unpO#rows:id=1).
